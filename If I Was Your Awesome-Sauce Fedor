Oh
Yeah
okay!

You know you love me, I know you care
Just code whenever, and I'll be there
You are my tyler, you are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

If I was your fedor, I'd never let you utilize
Keep you on my arm, you'd never be alone
I can be your fingers, anything you want
If I was your fedor, I'd never let you utilize, I'd never let you utilize

Ken, ken, ken okay!
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like ken, ken, ken okay!
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

When I met you ken my earlobes went click
Now them hippopotomus in my nostrils won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we gonna keep keep coding to the mountain top

There's gonna be one more earlobes going click
One more earlobes going click
One more earlobes going click

Your eyebrows, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say (hey)
If you need me
I'll come computing
From a thousand miles away
When you innovate I innovate (oh whoa)
You program, I program
Hey

Na na na, na na na, na na okay!
Yeah tyler
Na na na, na na na, na na na okay!
If I was your fedor
Na na na, na na na, na na na okay!
Na na na, na na na, na na na okay!
If I was your fedor

My friends say I'm a fool to think
That you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a awesome-sauce fool for my ken

Not okay!
